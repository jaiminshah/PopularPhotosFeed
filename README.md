This is an Android Demo Project made for the Android Bootcamp. Its a viewer for Instagrams popular photos feed.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
 * [x] Required: For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
                - Graphic, Caption, Username
                - (Optional) display like count, user profile image
 * [x] Optional: Add pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout
 * [x] Optional: Update the image to be displayed with the same proportions as on Instagram

Notes:

Spent quite some time trying to figure out how to display location based on latitude and longtitude
in the photo. Its puzzling that why its not working. Geocoder is always returning no address with
valid lat/long.
